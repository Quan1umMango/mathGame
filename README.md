# Math Game
A Command-Line mini-game to improve your mental mathematics.

```

```

Navigate to the directory.
Then build and run it.

```

## Background and Description
Made this to learn about the Go Programming language. Currently I made it so that you must ignore fractions in your calculations.
So 0.1 + 1 = 1
Easier to program and to solve for the user. 
Made the terminal app using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/master)

## Testing
Expr package has tests
```

```
